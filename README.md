## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Date: 8 February 2024.

This branch is a test to check how SwiftData works on RsyncUI. Major development is done, all functions seems to work as expected. Still there are QA and testing before a release is avaliable from GitHub. This version is now my daily driver. The main functions like synchronize data is not changed. SwiftData though requiere some changes in flow of data compared th the JSON version of RsyncUI.
