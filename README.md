## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Date: 9 February 2024.

V1.0.0 b(1) is released for test.

This version opf RsyncUI is a test to check how SwiftData works on RsyncUI. Major development is done, all functions to work as expected. This version is now my daily driver. The main functions like synchronize data is not changed. SwiftData though requiere some changes in flow of data compared th the JSON version of RsyncUI.

The major changes compared to the Homebrew version of RsyncUI, the JSON version, are the internal saving and administration of data about tasks, log records and user setting.
